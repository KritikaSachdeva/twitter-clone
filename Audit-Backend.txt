Started writing all routes in (routes > index.js)

login-signup:
we created a separate controller to handle sign-up login functionalities by the name of user controller
we used the code present in user.js routes after removing it from user.js under routes
we exported user controller class using an alias in index controller
we removed the schema present in user.js model and imported new user schema present in schema 
we imported user model from models in user.js controller and modified it so that direct routes weren't defined and made
required changes to code keeping rewriting to the minimum.
we added routes in index.js in routes and imported routes in main index file.

follow-unfollow with checks:
two versions of code were present one in controllers and the other in routes. we have used the code in follow route.
we removed schema from follower, following model and imported new schemas.
we imported new schemas and models in follow controller and removed the existing code and used the code present in follow route.
we restructured the code so that it follows proper structure and made changes with minimal rewrite .
we added checks to check whether or not that person already exists in his/her follower/following list. 
we added routes for it in index.js routes.
we removed code present in route follow.js.
